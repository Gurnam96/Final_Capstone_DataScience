Approach to Solve Business problem:

The Approach,that we will be using to solve the Business problem (which is: To Identify the Best Place for Opening a new Shoppe-chain in the city of Toronto and NewYork) is as follows:

We will be using the FourSquare Dataset for Toronto and NewYork(A Golden dataset for Geo-Spatial category)to first locate and identify what all the types of Shops are already available in these Cities (Toronto and NewYork).

We would also be considering some of the basic and important Statistics of these shoppe to build our solution more practically Recommendable.

We will be using the k-means Clustering to cluster the type of shoppe in the respective areas in a City.
Based on the final Clusters, we would be able to get/suggest the Best possible Place to our client for opening/setting up a New Shop/Business.
